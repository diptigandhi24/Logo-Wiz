# Logo Wiz

Make a simple logo quiz app as per the designs.

Youâ€™re free to fancy React, Vue, Svelte or any other well known web framework. If you prefer your web apps vanilla (JS) flavored, thats cool too.Your app should:
* Randomly select 20 logos for one run
* Maintain the score
* Match multiple keywords

## Make sure:
* the app is fast & the UX like hot knife on butter
* the code is neat, structured well & is a breeze to read
* is responsive and accessible

## Dazzle us ðŸ¤© :
* think of one awesomesauce feature of your own like custom ranks, save & load. imagine & make it happen.
